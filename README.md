# Machine Learning and Rust

This repo is me trying to or in a sense collating and implementing Machine Learning and General Machine Learning based functions that I use in my daily life. I have implemented them in Python, but in a sense Python's lack of type safety kind of makes it easy and actually hard to learning things. At least for me. Because variables can just exist and you can assign it to things and sometimes, it's hard to understand what the **RUST** is actually happening.

You're more than welcome to contribute, if you find errors and stuff. The code is obviously heavily commented ðŸ˜‚. If it feels verbose, don't forget to star the repo.

Repo's I got inspired from ahem....stole.....ahem code from:
